The information generated by the cookie about the way you use the website (including your IP address) will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating the way you use the website, compiling reports on website activity for Fimbl, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

### 5.2 Firebase Analytics

We use Firebase Analytics for the Fimbl App. Firebase Analytics is a service offered by Google Inc. located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

The service also records and analyzes certain user interests. The information processed via Google Firebase may also be used together with other Google services, such as Google Analytics and the Google marketing services. The tool uses identifiers such as the Android Advertising ID or the Advertising Identifier for iOS and cookie-like technologies to identify the users' mobile devices.
